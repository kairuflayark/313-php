				<h2>The Only True Story of Sheek the Liar</h2>
	      		<h5>as recounted by Zansa the curious.</h5>
	      		
	      		<h6>Prologue: Sheek steals my laundry.</h6>
	      		<p>	The caravan I was with was three days out from Blised when I first met Sheek.
	      		<br><br>
				I was taking a short furlough after some unpleasantness in my guild earlier that month. One of my fellow journeymen had an unfortunate encounter with an obscene amount of laxatives and the dining hall would take a few weeks to air out. Grandmage Valerian took advantage of the incident to send all of the journeymen, other than Blagg, out to study in other guild halls throughout the kingdom.
				<br><br>
				What? Why are you looking at me that way, it's not like I had anything to do with it!
				<br><br>
				Okay, I might have made some, and put them in his tea...and his stew...annnd sold a lot more to the other journeymen...In retrospect that whole debacle was my fault. But Bartholomew Blagg deserved everything that happened to him, and even the Grandmage agreed.
				<br>
				<br>
				He supplied the Senna Leaves.
				<br><br>
				Later on I realized that it also gave him a way to reinforce the other towns in the area, but that is getting ahead of myself. We were talking about Sheek though, not the mischief my journeyman self got up to. Now the thing that you need to understand about Sheek is that he was, is, and forever will be a scoundrel. And not one of those rakish noble lads that pretty ladies sigh over during balls. Sheek loves only a few things and those are money, tomato juice, actual tomato juice, and money. Fortunately he is possessed of some form of a moral compass, because he has never killed a man who has not deserved death... 
				<br><br>
				As far as I know.
				<br><br>
				I should have realized this when I saw him hunched over and rooting through my pack, only to vanish into the chaos of the caravan preparing to move out.
				<br><br>
				After all what kind of a monster steals a man's last pair of clean underclothes.
